<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3.VIP Subscriptions<br>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>

A liya VIP Subscription may be purchased in various packages, such as 7 days, 30 days, or 90 days VIP Subscriptions. For all mobile subscriptions, payment will be charged to your iTunes or Google account when you confirm your purchase. Your subscription will renew automatically for the same amount of time as your original subscription unless you switch off the auto-renew feature at least 24 hours before the end of your current subscription. This is because your account may be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of your current subscription period. You can manage your subscription and switch off auto-renewal by accessing your iTunes or Google account settings. You may not cancel your current subscription during the subscription period, although you may cancel automatic renewal at any time. Both Apple and Google facilitate “free trials” of subscription products (such as liya) for first-time users and we take advantage of that ability. For example, sometimes we may offer a free initial week to first-time liya subscribers. Eligibility for any such trial is limited to users who have not previously subscribed to liya, through either a current or prior liya account. If you are a previous liya subscriber and try to claim a free trial, you should be aware that Apple or Google may recognize your ineligibility. If so, you may not receive a free trial, but instead may be charged immediately for your first subscription month. This is a feature controlled by the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store, depending on which platform you use for liya. Purchases of Subscriptions are non-refundable and non-transferable, even if they expire or are discontinued. We may change the purchase price for VIP Subscriptions at any time, as well as the features included in VIP Subscriptions. We reserve the right to stop issuing Subscriptions at any time and to set expiration dates for Subscriptions. Subscriptions may not be redeemed for any sum of money or monetary value. If you delete your account or your account is terminated for any reason, you will lose all unused Subscription time without refund or other compensation.</span></p>
